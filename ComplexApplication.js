Content: Complex Application for Employee Management 

This code demonstrates a complex application for employee management. It includes employee classes, salary calculations, performance evaluations, and reporting. The code is divided into different modules for better organization and to follow best practices.

Note: This is a simplified example and does not contain all the necessary validation and error handling.

// Module 1: Employee Classes

class Employee {
  constructor(name, age, joiningYear) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.joiningYear = joiningYear;
  }

  calculateSalary() {
    // Implementation of salary calculation logic
    return 0;
  }
}

class RegularEmployee extends Employee {
  constructor(name, age, joiningYear, salary) {
    super(name, age, joiningYear);
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  calculateSalary() {
    // Implementation of salary calculation logic for regular employees
    return this.salary;
  }
}

class ContractualEmployee extends Employee {
  constructor(name, age, joiningYear, hourlyRate, hoursWorked) {
    super(name, age, joiningYear);
    this.hourlyRate = hourlyRate;
    this.hoursWorked = hoursWorked;
  }

  calculateSalary() {
    // Implementation of salary calculation logic for contractual employees
    return this.hourlyRate * this.hoursWorked;
  }
}

// Module 2: Performance Evaluation

function evaluatePerformance(employee) {
  // Implementation of performance evaluation logic
  // Assign performance ratings, bonuses, etc.
}

// Module 3: Reporting

function generateReport(employees) {
  // Implementation of report generation logic
  // Generate a report based on employee data
}

// Module 4: Main Application

function main() {
  const employees = [];

  const employee1 = new RegularEmployee("John Doe", 30, 2015, 5000);
  employees.push(employee1);

  const employee2 = new ContractualEmployee("Jane Smith", 25, 2020, 20, 160);
  employees.push(employee2);

  for (const employee of employees) {
    const salary = employee.calculateSalary();
    evaluatePerformance(employee);
    // Perform other necessary operations
  }

  generateReport(employees);
}

main();
